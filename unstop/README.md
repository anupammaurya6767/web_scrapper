# UNSTOP Data Scraper

This Python script allows you to scrape hackathon data from the UNSTOP website and extract relevant information such as the "title," "link," "mode of participation," and "Date." It uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests and `Selenium` for HTML parsing.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your Python environment:

- Python 3.x
- requests library
- selenium library
- pymongo library

## Installation of Chrome driver for selenium on MacOS
This is by far the easiest option:
`brew install chromedriver --cask`

To upgrade an existing installation do this:
`brew upgrade chromedriver --cask`
